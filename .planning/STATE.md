## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Core GTD first, calendar sync later: Reduce complexity of initial build; get the system working before integrations
- Personal only, no sharing: User reports progress separately; simplifies auth and data model
- Web app over desktop app: User wants browser tab alongside work tools
- Full GTD over simplified version: User wants the complete methodology
- Use Tailwind v4 with Vite plugin: Modern Tailwind setup, no PostCSS config needed (01-01)
- Use Svelte 5 $state runes: Modern reactive state over writable stores (01-01)
- Use Dexie 4.x EntityTable: Full TypeScript type safety for database operations (01-01)
- Use {@render children()} Svelte 5 snippet syntax over <slot />: Modern Svelte 5 pattern (01-02)
- Fixed sidebar layout pattern (240px left, flex-1 main, fixed footer): Professional productivity app standard (01-02)
- Service worker cache-first for assets: Instant load from cache, offline-first UX (01-02)
- Non-blocking persistence request on mount: Don't block app load, request happens in background (01-02)
- Use Dexie multi-valued index for full-text search: Native IndexedDB feature, no additional libraries, excellent performance (02-01)
- Tokenize on write via Dexie hooks: Better search performance than tokenizing on read (02-01)
- Filter searches to active types only: Someday/Maybe items excluded from quick search results (02-01)
- Use native Intl.RelativeTimeFormat: Zero dependencies for relative time formatting (02-01)
- Inline capture input (not modal): Fastest possible capture - input always visible, no click to open (02-02)
- FIFO list rendering (oldest first): GTD methodology encourages processing in order of arrival (02-02)
- Achievement-oriented empty state: "Your inbox is clear" feels like accomplishment (02-02)
